# Guidelime_Zarant

## Overview
This is primarily an in-game alliance hunter leveling guide for Classic WoW written as an addon module for Guidelime. 

This guide might work for other classes, however, at early levels (1-30) the route used might not be optimal, since it doesn't take into account class specific quests and spell training requirements.

If you need pointers on how to do the more techincal stuff like soloing elite quests or executing some of the wall jumps, you can watch the last 1-60 run I recorded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbBITS39hsA&list=PLablGtn8YKUmwMYdqE-9xVCDZu0bQZ8eg),  additionally you can check out my Twitch channel ([http://www.twitch.tv/Zarant_](http://www.twitch.tv/Zarant_)) for more Classic WoW speedrunning related stuff.

## Setup
- Download and install this addon, if you are downloading from GitHub make sure to remove the `-master` from the folder name.
- Download and install [Guidelime](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/Guidelime)
- Make sure you enable both `Guidelime` and `Guidelime_Zarant` before logging in
- Once you log in, press ESC to open the options menu, click on Interface Options, switch to the AddOns tab, select Guidelime from the list on the left and then scroll down to select the guide you want to load.

Due to some limitations with Guidelime, some steps have to be completed manually, if you wish to enable step auto completion, you need to edit the Guidelime.toc after installing Guidelime and add the following line at the end:

`..\Guidelime_Zarant\Guidelime_Zarant.lua`

## FAQ

I get a lot of questions from people starting this guide from some arbitrary level, the way this guide is set up, it's broken down into 3 independent chunks:

* The first segment is from 1-29 (starting zone to wetlands).
* The second segment is from 29-43 (Duskwood to late STV), and you can start it anywhere between level 29 and 32, the Duskwood segment relies on some other quests being done beforehand, but you can easily make up for it by grinding mobs.
* The third segment starts in Feralas and you can start it anywhere between level 43 and 48.

If you start any of those segments at the level I suggested, the XP loss from skipping any quests that you don't have is minimal. For people starting at level 52 (from Maraudon boosts) I recommend starting with the Searing Gorge segment and then skipping the Hinterlands segment and the Feralas segment at 53.
