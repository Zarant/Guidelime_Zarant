# Guidelime_Zarant
## Overview
This is primarily an in-game alliance hunter leveling guide for Classic WoW written as an addon module for Guidelime. 

This guide might work for other classes, however, at early levels (1-30) the route used might not be optimal, since it doesn't take into account class specific quests and spell training requirements.

## Setup
- Download and install this addon
- Download and install [Guidelime](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/Guidelime)
- Make sure you enable both `Guidelime` and `Guidelime_Zarant` before logging in
- Once you log in, press ESC to open the options menu, click on Interface Options, switch to the AddOns tab, select Guidelime from the list on the left and then scroll down to select the guide you want to load.

This guide was mainly written for personal use and being a veteran player, I omitted some information to keep it concise. If you feel like some key information is missing from a particular section, please let me know. 

If you need pointers on how to do the more techincal stuff like soloing elite quests or executing some of the wall jumps, you can watch the last 1-60 run I recorded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbBITS39hsA&list=PLablGtn8YKUmwMYdqE-9xVCDZu0bQZ8eg), additionally you can check out my [Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/Zarant_) for more Classic WoW speedrunning related stuff.
